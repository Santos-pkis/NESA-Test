          NESA Africa, formerly known by different names, has undergone an
          evolutionary transformation from its initial concept in 2010. Over the
          years, the initiative faced numerous challenges, including funding
          limitations, stakeholder alignment, and logistical constraints.
          However, through resilience and continuous refinement, NESA Africa has
          emerged as the leading pan-African platform for recognizing excellence
          in education.
