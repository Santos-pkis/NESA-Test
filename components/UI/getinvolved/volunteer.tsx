            of a transformative movement that recognizes and promotes excellence in
            education across Africa. As a volunteer, you will contribute your skills,

            such as event coordination, outreach, digital engagement, logistics, and

            management, media, or advocacy, your involvement helps ensure the success
            of NESA Africa while gaining valuable experience, networking opportunities,
            and professional recognition. Join our team and be a driving force behind
